## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- Add budget amount to category.
- Add transaction amount to category.

## My process

- In this project, I refactored an existing Redux application using Redux Toolkitâ€™s `createSlice()` method, which simplified managing actions and reducers.
- First, I created a slice for the `budgets` state using `createSlice()`, which automatically generated action creators and reducers.
- I defined the slice with a `name`, an `initialState`, and a `reducers` object that contained the necessary logic, like the `editBudget` case.
- Once that slice was set up, I deleted the manually written action creators and reducers for budgets.
- Next, I applied the same process to the `transactions` slice.
- I defined actions like `addTransaction` and `deleteTransaction` within the `reducers` property of `createSlice()`.
- These reducers handled adding or deleting transactions from the state.
- After that, I cleaned up the code by removing the manually created transaction actions and reducers, and exported the auto-generated ones instead.
- This refactoring reduced boilerplate code and made the application more efficient and easier to maintain, while still allowing it to track budgets and transactions effectively.
